<h2>Inheritance</h2>

<p>The concept of inheritence makes possible building object prototype</p>

<h3>How inheritance works in JS</h3>
<p>In JS a prototype is an object that can hold multiple properties to share an object</p>




<h2> Creating classes</h2>
<p>
 The concept of extending classes using basic inheritance to alter behaviors within child classes.

Inheritance in JavaScript is based around the prototype object. </p>

<p>
All objects that are built from the prototype share the same functionality.

When you need to code more complex OOP relationships, you can use the
 class keyword and its easy-to-understand and easy-to-reason-about syntax.
